## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Running the application

Notice that the `.env.docker` file is used to set the environment variables for the application in **development**. You can change the values in this file to suit your needs.

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the application and the database. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
